  abstract = {Cataloging resources that assist in educating a domain specific community can require a finer level of granularity than objects that arc to be accessed by a more general domain community, and can become a costly process. One possible approach towards cataloging such resources is to get a community of providers involved in cataloging the materials that they provide. This paper introduces RePEc (http://netec.wust.edu/RePEc) as an example tor such an approach. RePEc is mainly a catalog of research papers in Economics. RePEc is based on set of over 80 archives, which all work independently but are interoperable. The key issue of the paper is to evaluate the success in providing data of reasonable quality a decentralized approach.},

  abstract = {The popularity of GitHub is growing, among not only software developers but also statisticians and data scientists. In this article, I discuss why social coding platforms such as GitHub are preferable for developing, documenting, maintaining, and collaborating on statistical software. Furthermore, I introduce the github command version 2.0 for Stata, which facilitates building, searching, installing, and managing statistical packages hosted on GitHub. I also provide a command for searching filenames in all Stata packages published on the Statistical Software Components Archive and GitHub to ensure unique filenames and package names, which is a common concern among Stata programmers. I make further suggestions to enhance the practice of developing and hosting statistical packages on GitHub as well as using them for data analysis.},
