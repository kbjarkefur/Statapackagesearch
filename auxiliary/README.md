# Incorporating more detailed command names from packages

This list of commands was provided by Sergio Correia. It will need to be updated. It originated as a Stata dataset, created by Python.

For now, we simply convert this into the format necessary to be used by the existing command.

When updating, simply run the program "convert_signalcommands.do" in this directory.
